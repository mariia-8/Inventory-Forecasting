# Inventory-Forecasting
This project aims to support an online gift store with inventory planning by forecasting inventory levels for each product using Multi Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. 
This analysis consists of the following steps:
1. Business and data understanding. I performed exploratory data analysis in Python to investigate data formats, missing values, duplicate entries, and other data inconsistencies.
2. Data preparation. This step involves data cleaning part to ensure data integrity and validity as well as feature extraction from time-series data. Creating relevant features requires some research on the following key questions to better understand the factors influencing inventory levels:
    1. What products, on average, are ordered in large volumes?
    2. What products are in high demand based on sales volume and frequency of transactions?
    3. Are there any seasonal factors that influence customer behavior?
    4. What products are in high demand based on sales volume and frequency of transactions?

3. Modeling
4. Evaluation
5. Results communication

To sum up, the Support Vector Machine model performed better compared to the Multi Linear Regression and Random Forest, yielding lower MSE.
