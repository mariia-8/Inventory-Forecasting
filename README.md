# Inventory-Forecasting
This project aims to support a small gift store with inventory planning by forecasting inventory levels for each product using Multi Linear Regression and Random Forest. The CRISP-DM method was used to guide the data mining process, including business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. 

Random Forecast performed better compared to the Multi Linear regression by yielding lower MSE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation metrics. Random Forest provides moderately accurate predictions, suggesting that the model generally offers improvement over simpler models like Multi Linear Regression. The MAPE of 19.33% suggests that the forecasts would deviate by around one-fifth of the actual values. Based on the RMSE value the prediction error is on average 2-3 units of product per month. 
However, there are still some risks when using the Random Forest Model. The predicted results underestimated the quantity by 13.7 %, leading to a 14.8% difference in revenue.
